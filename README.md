# Ecommerce-Follow-Along
#Milestone 1:#
Overview:
ShopEase is a robust e-commerce website built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It is designed to offer users a seamless shopping experience, providing easy browsing, secure transactions, and personalized recommendations. This project is a practical implementation of full-stack development concepts.

Key Features:

Product Catalog: Browse and search through a variety of products effortlessly.

User Authentication: Secure login and registration system for personalized user experiences.

Shopping Cart: Add, update, or remove items before proceeding to checkout.

Order Management: Track orders, view order history, and handle payments securely.

Admin Panel: Manage products, orders, and users with administrative controls.



Tech Stack:
Front-End: React — for building an interactive and responsive user interface.

Back-End: Node.js with Express — for server-side logic and API handling.

Database: MongoDB — for efficient storage and retrieval of product, user, and order data.


Why This Project?

This project aims to simulate the development of a real-world e-commerce platform while giving hands-on experience with the MERN stack. It’s a great way to understand the interplay between the front-end, back-end, and database, while solving a common user problem: making online shopping simple and enjoyable.


#Milestone 2#:
Description
In Milestone 2, I focused on structuring the project and setting up the frontend and backend for the e-commerce application. This milestone involved configuring the development environment, creating a functional login page, and laying the foundation for future API integrations.

What I Learned
Project Folder Structure: I organized the project files into separate directories for the frontend (React) and backend (Node.js), streamlining the development process.
React Frontend Setup: I initialized a React app to handle the user interface, ensuring a smooth foundation for building the app's frontend.
Node.js Backend Setup: I set up a basic Node.js server to handle backend functionality, preparing for API integration in later milestones.
Tailwind CSS Integration: I configured Tailwind CSS to enable utility-based, responsive styling throughout the project.
Login Page Development: I created the first user interface of the e-commerce platform—a functional and styled login page—allowing users to securely log into the platform.
Key Features
Folder Structure: Organized files into frontend and backend directories for better management.
Login Page: A functional login page for users to access the platform securely.
Styling: Used Tailwind CSS to style the application with modern, responsive design principles.

#Milestone 3#
Project Description
In Milestone 3, I focused on setting up the backend for the e-commerce application. This milestone involved organizing the backend code, connecting the application to MongoDB, setting up a Node.js server, and implementing basic error handling to ensure smooth operation.

What I Learned
Backend Folder Structure: I organized the backend code into a structured hierarchy, with separate folders for routes, controllers, models, and middleware.
Server Setup: I initialized a Node.js server using Express and configured it to listen on a designated port, ready to handle incoming API requests.
MongoDB Integration: I connected the application to MongoDB, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.
Error Handling: I implemented basic error handling to provide clear messages for debugging and better user feedback when something goes wrong.

Key Features
Backend Organization: Set up a clean folder structure for organizing backend files.
Server Initialization: Configured a basic Node.js server using Express.
Database Connection: Successfully integrated MongoDB for data management.
Error Handling: Added basic error handling for smoother server operation.

#Milestone 4#

Description
In Milestone 4, I expanded the backend functionality of the e-commerce application by introducing user data management and file uploads. This involved creating a User Model and Controller, as well as configuring Multer for handling file uploads like profile pictures.

What I Learned
User Model Creation: Designed a blueprint for user data, specifying fields like name, email, and password using a MongoDB schema.

User Controller: Implemented logic to manage user-related operations, such as adding new users and retrieving their information.
File Uploads with Multer: Configured Multer to handle and store file uploads securely, enabling the application to accept user-uploaded images.

Key Features

User Model: Defined the structure for user data in the database using MongoDB schemas.

User Controller: Managed server-side operations related to users, like handling requests for user registration or retrieval.

File Uploads: Enabled file upload functionality, allowing users to upload profile pictures that are stored on the server.

Submission Summary
Code Push: All code changes have been pushed to the GitHub repository used for previous milestones.

Repository Accessibility: The repository is publicly accessible.

README Update: Added a summary of Milestone 4 progress to the README file.

File Upload Support: Successfully configured Multer for handling and storing user-uploaded images.
