# E-commerce-along
Project Overview
The e-commerce platform will provide functionalities such as:
This project is a full-stack e-commerce application built using the MERN stack, which consists of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. The goal of the project is to create a robust, scalable, and secure online shopping platform, with a focus on clean and efficient code architecture.


Key features of the project:
This project will be built using MERN Stack.
-REST API Creation: Through the mentor-guided project, you will learn to build scalable APIs.
Authentication: You will get to learn to implement secure login and registration functionalities. -Database Schema Design: You will get to explore how to create structured data models using MongoDB.
-Backend Development: As a part of the project, you will learn to set up robust server-side logic with Node.js and Express.

User Authentication: Secure user registration and login system, allowing customers to access personalized features and make purchases.
Product Management: Ability for admins to add, update, and manage product listings, including categories, pricing, and descriptions.
Order Handling: Managing customer orders, tracking order status, and updating users with order confirmations and shipping details.
REST APIs: A set of RESTful endpoints for interacting with the frontend and performing operations such as registering a user, retrieving products, and placing orders.
By using the MERN stack, this project benefits from a unified JavaScript development environment, where both frontend and backend are written in JavaScript. This streamlines the development process, making it easier to build and maintain the application.

Tech Stack:
Frontend: React.js for dynamic user interfaces and fast performance.
Backend: Node.js with Express for creating RESTful APIs to handle user submissions, voting, and song data
